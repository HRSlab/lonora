== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= This looks familiar =
* This plugin is inspired by Mika Epsteins Banhammer plugin with some improved routines and borrows some methods from WP No Bot Question from Digicompitech. I have rewritten most methods to work easier and more efficient. But the core functionality is very similar.
